# Multithreaded-Ray-Tracer-with-Scene-Parsing
A C++ ray tracing engine designed to render 3D scenes efficiently using multithreading. Parses scene description files to load cameras, lights, and geometric objects. Implements basic lighting and shading models to produce BMP image output. Utilizes GLM for mathematical operations and Boost for command-line interface parsing.

Multithreaded rendering for performance

Scene file parser for flexible input

Support for lights, camera, and object definitions

Lighting and shading implementation

Output as 24-bit BMP image

GLM for vector/matrix math

Boost.Program_options for CLI support
